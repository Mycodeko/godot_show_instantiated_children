# Show Instantiated Children
Automatically shows instantiated children during exported NodePath selection to allow for relative parent-child structures without needing scripts to reveal inner children.

## Usage
### Installation
1. Download the source code zip archive [here](https://github.com/Mycodeko/godot_show_instantiated_children/releases/latest).
2. Extract the `show_instantiated_children` folder at `godot_show_instantiated_children-1.0.0/addons/show_instantiated_children` into `<PROJECT_DIRECTIORY>/addons` (should result in `<PROJECT_DIRECTIORY>/addons/show_instantiated_children`).
3. Enable the plugin in Godot at `Project -> Project Settings... -> Plugins -> ShowInstantiatedChildren (Enabled: On)`.

Now when you click an option that opens the SceneTreeEditor, all nodes will be shown for selection.
